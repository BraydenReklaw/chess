# My Notes

## Java Fundamentals

Similar to C++. References, not pointers. Compiler vs interpreter : compilers define code instructions for a system and then go to the system, interpreters go to system first before defining code instructions. Compilers are fast but less portable (need multiple copies of the code for different platforms/systems) while interpreters are very portable. Java is a hybrid. code is compiled for a virtual machine (most common denominator for a machine) which is then further defined for each individual machine's required.

`MyCLass.java` = source file. `MyClass.class` = executable file

`public static void main(String [] args)` - executable main method function/class. (String ... args).
